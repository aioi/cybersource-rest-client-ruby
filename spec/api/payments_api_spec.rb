  # unit tests for create_payment
  # Process a Payment
  # A payment authorizes the amount for the transaction. There are a number of supported payment feature, such as E-commerce and Card Present - Credit Card/Debit Card, Echeck, e-Wallets, Level II/III Data, etc..  A payment response includes the status of the request. It also includes processor-specific information when the request is successful and errors if unsuccessful. See the [Payments Developer Guides Page](https://developer.cybersource.com/api/developer-guides/dita-payments/GettingStarted.html).  Authorization can be requested with Capture, Decision Manager, Payer Authentication(3ds), and Token Creation. Find more on [Authorization with Add-On Features page.] (https://developer.cybersource.com/api/authorization-add-ons.html)  Possible [RESPONSE CODES](https://developer.cybersource.com/api/reference/response-codes.html) .  Processor specific [Testing Triggers](https://developer.cybersource.com/hello-world/testing-guide.html).
